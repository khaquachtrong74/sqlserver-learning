# Rules
# First Normal Form (1NF)
1. Using row order to convey information is not permitted
2. Mixing data types within the same column is not permitted
3. Having a table without a primary key is not permitted
4. Repeating groups are not permitted
# Second Normal Form (2NF)
Each non-key attributes in the table muse be dependent on the entire primary key
# Third Normal Form (3NF)
Each non-key attributes in the table muse be depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key
# Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
Each attributes in the table muse be depend on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key
# Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
The only kinds of multivalued dependency allowed in a table are multivalued dependencies on the non-key
# Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
It must not be possible to describe the table as being the logical result of joining some other tables together
